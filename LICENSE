Special Note for Municipalities and NGOs:

This software is provided free of charge for use by municipal authorities
and animal welfare NGOs. We encourage its adoption to improve both human
safety and animal welfare through data-driven decision making.

The creators of Safe Paws believe in balancing human safety with compassion
for street animals. This tool is designed to enable targeted, humane
interventions rather than emotional or blanket responses.
